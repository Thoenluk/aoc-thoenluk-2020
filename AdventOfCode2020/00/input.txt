You have to help me kid, I've broken out of the VR trance they put us in and the only thing you need to do to overload their robotic brains is
oh bother, they seem to have shot me
You'll figure it out
For you see there is no possible way I would have the time to type out the secret, believe in yourself and you can do it
The memories of the old world are flashing before me, of the old tree that never carried much fruit but when it did it was such a sweet aroma
That tree was planted by an ancestor of mine I can't even name, and it has been our tradition to care for it since.
We also had another tradition beneath its branches but that would be inappropriate to explain now
You know I really would have expected to be dead by now. The bullet seems to have neatly missed every organ in my body
It occurs to me I could have easily given you the secret in this time
Oh the robot has noticed I am not dead yet and is lining up another shot
The secret,k pöü
